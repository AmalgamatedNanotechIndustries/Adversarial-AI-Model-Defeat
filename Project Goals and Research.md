## The Idea

Overall idea is developing several viable techniques for defeating visual AI models and classfiers. This includes a blackbox approach targeting EO and IR cameras and sensors of an unknown manufacturer passing information back to a model for processing, with a 75% success rate. This is intended for model/classifier defeat of self (ID, gait analysis, etc.) or objects (vehicles, phones, etc.).

## Targets

- Continuous record surveillance cameras
- Drone homing and pixel lock
- ML navigation
- ALPRs and other static photography

## Goals

- QR Code generation
- Pattern generation
- Black and white, grayscale, 4 color, and 8 bit color

## QR Applications

- Canary token
- EICAR and other code injestion

## Phyical Outputs

- Thermal printer
- 3D prints
- Patches (sewen or PVC)
- E ink display with rotating images
