## The Idea

Overall intent is to develop several viable techniques for defeating visual AI models and classfiers. This includes a blackbox approach targeting EO and IR cameras and sensors of an unknown manufacturer passing information back to a model for processing, with a 75% success rate.

## Targets

- Continuous record surveillance cameras
- Drone homing and pixel lock
- ML navigation
- ALPRs and other static photography

## Goals

- QR Code generation
- Pattern generation
- Black and white, grayscale, 4 color, and 8 bit color

## Phyical Outputs

- Thermal printer
- 3D prints
- Patches (sewen or PVC)

## Stretch goals

- E ink display
